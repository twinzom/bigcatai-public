* US taxpayers can deduct interest on qualified residential home mortgages, loans used to make taxable investments, and loans taken for capital commitments to an operating trade or business
* Rates have risen significantly during the first quarter of 2022
* Mortgage interest deduction is available only if loan proceeds are used to build, acquire or make capital improvements on a qualified property
* Borrowing for investment purposes is better, tax-wise, than borrowing to purchase a home
* Interest paid on debt proceeds that can be traced to the acquisition of taxable investments is deductible up to all of your investment income for that year
* Interest paid on debt incurred to purchase equity or make additional capital contributions to an operating trade or business is deductible against all of the taxpayer’s income, including non-business income
- Assume someone wants to buy a $10 million residence and is thinking about borrowing to fund a portion of the purchase price. 
- Two options: Get a $4 million mortgage (deductible interest on only $750,000 of the mortgage) or liquidate $4 million in investments (all of the interest on the loan may be deductible).
- Difference in tax savings between these two options is potentially significant.
- Advanced strategy: Integrating rate swaps to fix the interest rate and ensure the deductibility of the interest paid.
- Make sure loan qualifies as a tax-deductible interest expense.
- Discuss strategies with tax advisors.
- Make a plan today that even “future you” will love.","2022-04-20","null"

- Research has shown that people are more willing to purchase tickets after losing money relative to losing the tickets
- Consider how you assign your money to different mental accounts, such as monetary gifts, tax refunds, bonuses, etc.
- Establish a physical framework for your money to ensure it is being used in the most productive way
- Four buckets to consider: liquidity (cash), lifestyle (spending), legacy, and perpetual growth
- Liquidity bucket should have enough money on hand to feel psychologically safe and cover typical lifestyle expenses, taxes, big purchases, etc.
- Lifestyle bucket should have enough money to provide for lifestyle needs and wants for the rest of one's life
- Legacy bucket should have money to benefit people or organizations beyond one's lifetime, such as family gifts, philanthropic gifts, etc.
- Perpetual Growth bucket is meant to provide capital growth in perpetuity and typically includes long-term investing strategies that are more aggressive, concentrated positions or investments, businesses and investment real estate
- Aligning buckets with your intentions involves identifying the buckets that may apply to you, as well as what and how much is in each of those buckets, and then thinking through the various goals that would align to each of the buckets
- Goals have four fundamental pillars: a desired dollar amount, time horizon, priority level and a label

- Grow: To create a strategy and family culture that enable wealth to grow in perpetuity (often via a family business or pooled family investments)

- Need for active tax management is greater than ever due to elevated volatility and more modest forward-looking return expectations
- Incorporating tax loss harvesting into portfolios' ongoing management is an opportune time due to high volatility and lower forward-looking returns
- Tax loss harvesting can help transform market volatility into tax benefits by seeking to realize losses to offset capital gains and reduce taxes owed
- Tax loss harvesting can help take home more of return while staying close to objectives
- Higher volatility means more opportunities to capture losses and generate tax deductions
- Selling investment for lower price than originally paid to realize loss for tax purposes, then purchasing similar investment to preserve portfolio's asset allocation
- Tax loss harvesting can result in up to $16,320 of potential federal income tax savings
- Tax loss harvesting historically done once a year, but tech-enabled tax-smart investing can help capture market dips during the year
- Innovations in technology can help you take full advantage of year-round tax loss harvesting, by systematically capturing losses to offset gains, now or in the future, all the while staying close to your objectives.
- Think twice about how much you want to hold in cash and cash equivalents this year.

- Generally speaking, this rule prevents you from claiming a current tax loss if you buy a security considered “substantially identical” within a 30-day period before or after the loss trade date.
- After offsetting capital gains, individuals can use up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be used to offset ordinary income, with any amount not utilized carried forward indefinitely.

- Consider funding a CD (certificate of deposit account) for those who want to be extremely conservative and are comfortable leaving a sum untouched for an amount of time (typically for three months, six, nine or 12). Funds are secured by the U.S. government and are insured up to $250,000 in any single deposit account by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
- Money market funds enable regular withdrawal money, but the funds kept in the account are actually invested in the market. Market funds are not federally insured, so there is possibility of loss. However, they generally invest in low-risk, high-quality, short-term debt securities and are very highly regulated.
- Mutual funds that make slightly longer-duration investments than a money market fund, investing in corporate securities and are taxable, or municipal bonds (“munis”) with potential tax advantages.
- Separately managed accounts (SMAs) for those who can tie cash up for nine or more months.
- Portfolio Line of Credit (PLC) for those who need to make large purchases or pay unexpected large expenses, without having to keep large cash reserves idle or sell the carefully selected assets in their portfolios.
- Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the mutual funds before investing.
- Funds invested in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates.
- Income from investments in municipal securities is exempt from federal income tax.
- For some investors, income may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.
- Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable.
- Income may be subject to state and local taxes.
- SMA’s are subject to market risks.

- Amanda Lott and Sarah Backer are part of the Wealth Planning Strategy team
- Once you reach a certain age, you must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) or traditional IRA each year or face harsh penalties
- Generally, you must take an annual RMD before December 31 of the year you turn 72
- You can delay taking your first RMD until April 1 of the year following the year you turn 72, but you will end up taking two in that year
- If you don't take your RMDs on time, you face paying tax penalties of up to 50% of the outstanding RMD you're due
- You can have up to $100,000 distributed directly to a qualified charity as a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) to avoid adding some of the RMD amount to your taxable income for the year
- You can withdraw more than the RMD if it makes sense to do so based on your individual circumstances
- Consider converting your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to exempt any future growth from income taxes and RMDs
- If you inherit an IRA, you may want to stretch out the RMDs for as long as possible
- If the beneficiary of an inherited IRA passes, the account is then transferred to the beneficiaries the original beneficiary has designated and the minimum distribution schedule is not reset.
- The SECURE Act of 2019 changed the rules for RMDs, requiring them to begin at age 72 for those who turned 70½ after 12/31/2019.
- For Roth IRAs, an original owner has no RMD.
- Proposed regulations issued by the Treasury Department and IRS in early 2022 would require that non-eligible designated beneficiaries of inherited IRAs and defined contribution plans take annual distributions if the decedent was already taking RMDs.
- Goals-Based Planning can help create the legacy you envision and avoid unintended consequences.

- US Federal Reserve taking inflation more seriously, anticipating three or four interest rate hikes this year, with the first one coming in March
- Fed has been faced with a rapidly flattening yield curve, inflation expectations dropping, and the 10-year breakeven inflation rate falling from a 2.75% high to 2.45% in January
- As the Fed tightens policy by selling Treasuries, demand for the bonds will drop unless investors take up the slack
- Five-year government debt seems to offer the most value, as it is typically less price-sensitive to any potential volatility at the long end of the yield curve
- Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has defended the policy of letting the economy run “hot”, to ensure a wide job market recovery
- Tapering of current bond purchases is expected to be much quicker than had been expected, opening the door for a first hike in March
- Market has accelerated the flattening process with the two- and five-year point of the yield curve, moving them significantly upwards
- Fed seems to acknowledge that accommodation must be more dynamic along the path towards the “end point”
- Three US rate hikes this year, as suggested by the Fed’s dot plot, seems to be very likely, with a fourth increase possible
- Potential for a surprise 50bp hike in March if higher persistent inflation opens up
- Fed balance sheet may start to reduce in first or second quarter of this year
- $1.9 trillion of the Fed’s $5.6 trillion Treasury holdings mature in 2022

- Many countries’ supply chains have demonstrated resilience, allowing them to counter headwinds and bottlenecks seen elsewhere
- Modernised strategies, technological innovation and efforts to improve sustainability can equip corporates with the tools they need to adapt to disruption
- Prior to the pandemic, supply chains rarely contended with ‘black swan events’
- Asia has fared better than other regions due to its highly diversified manufacturing supply chains
- Building greater resilience into supply chains may appear costly, but not doing so could be far more expensive
- Technology will play a key role in improving supply chains, such as data analytics and digitisation
- Companies must develop an overall supply chain strategy, covering the supply-chain process, the infrastructure and network, the information systems, and the people
- Global businesses that have coped well during the supply chain crisis have typically already implemented “supply chain towers”
- Opportunities for investment in companies that implement automation, robotics and digital supply chain tools
- Benefits from geographical diversification of supply chains
- Companies that fail to implement resilient supply chains will be vulnerable to future shocks
- Risk factor for markets due to close links between supply chains and ESG standards, sustainability and progress towards net zero","2022-10-27","null"

- The Fed is not ready to quickly pull back and end policy rate hikes, and is likely to lean into front-loading rate hikes.
- Risk assets have rallied from the recent June bottom, but it remains a fragile market rally.
- The challenge for central banks is how much is too much tightening.
- The global economy is unwinding excess stimulus, and there is a real problem with inflation that central banks need to get in front of.
- Equity markets are back to long-term average valuation levels, but if earnings move lower, risk assets will be put under pressure.
- We’re seeing a meaningful slowdown in global economic data, signaling a pullback in demand.
- If the narrative for consumers is that inflation is too high and expectations are that it’s going to stay that way, the Fed needs to move quickly to contain rising inflation expectations.
- Fed is not ready to pull back and end policy rate hikes
- ECB and Bank of England have abandoned forward policy rate guidance
- Labor markets need to cool for central banks to pivot
- Markets expect Fed policy rate to end this year between 3.5-4%
- Risk assets have rallied since mid-June bottom
- Positioning and sentiment were due for a squeeze higher
- Supply chains appear to be improving and oil prices have reverted back to pre-Russia invasion levels
- Reduced equity overweight and moved underweight European equity markets
- Neutral duration and overweight U.S. dollar across multi-asset portfolios

- Weak economic environment can get worse due to Russia holding back energy exports
- Winter is geopolitically empowering for Putin to put economic pressure on Europe
- Policy rate normalization is a process, not an event
- Easy rollover in inflation expected a quarter earlier
- Markets rarely trade for long at historic averages
- Challenge for policymakers and investors is how much is too much tightening
- Markets giving policymakers benefit of the doubt
- Fed needs to see “compelling evidence” of moderating inflation
- Inflation seems to be peaking
- 75bps rate hike this month from the Fed

• U.S. investors may be able to take advantage of certain lending techniques and trusts to transfer wealth with little to no gift tax consequence in a low interest rate environment
• The minimum interest rate for loans of this nature is determined by the Internal Revenue Service and changes monthly
• The impact of a low interest rate can be magnified when lending non-cash assets whose value can be discounted
• Intra-family loans, installment sales to an irrevocable grantor trust, and grantor retained annuity trusts are techniques that can enable senior family members to “freeze” the value of the assets that they lend
• Legislation has been proposed to diminish or, in certain cases, eliminate the benefits of some of these techniques, and as interest rates rise, the effectiveness of these techniques would be reduced
- A GRAT is a grantor trust to which the donor transfers property and from which the donor receives a payment of a fixed amount each year for a term of years
- The transfer of property to the GRAT should not trigger any gift tax to the donor, and the annuity payments themselves from the trust to the donor will not be taxable
- To the extent the GRAT generates taxable income and gain, the donor would have to pay tax on that income and gain

- Myth #1: It is not always wise to name a family member as the sole trustee, as it can be a considerable undertaking and the trustee is personally liable for handling the trust’s investments, safeguarding trust assets, recordkeeping, tax filings and interpreting the trust
- Myth #2: Corporate trustees can be trusted to take the time to know the beneficiaries of a trust and understand their needs, and distributions are automatic for nondiscretionary trusts
- Myth #3: Corporate trustees can manage trusts with illiquid assets, as trust law has evolved and directed trusts can be used to give families control over heirloom assets
- Directed trust provides family with benefit of corporate trustee's experience and administrative expertise 
- Trustees have a duty to invest portfolio prudently, including duty to diversify investment portfolios

-The wash sale rule prohibits taxpayers from claiming a loss on the sale or other disposition of a stock or securities if, within the 61-day period that begins 30 days before the sale, they acquire the same or a “substantially identical” stock or securities; or enter a contract to acquire stock or securities (e.g., call options).
-Consequences of running afoul of the wash sale rule can be significant: the loss from the sale of the original shares is disallowed, the amount of the disallowed loss is added to the basis of the newly acquired shares, and the taxpayer’s holding period on the original shares is added to the holding period of the newly acquired shares.
-The wash sale rule applies to transactions in stock or securities, including debt securities, and contracts to acquire stocks or securities.
-Types of transactions that may not trigger a wash sale: selling an active manager at a loss and buying a different active manager; selling an active strategy at a loss and buying a passive strategy (or vice versa).
-Transactions that will not trigger a wash sale: selling allocated gold at a loss and buying another allocated or unallocated position (or vice versa); buying a lot and selling a part of that same lot at a loss within 30 days, if no other lots have been purchased.
- Buying a new lot and liquidating the entire position at a loss within 30 days (without a subsequent transaction that might trigger the wash sale rule within the wash sale window period)
- Selling a position at a loss within 30 days of receiving a gift of that position
- Selling a position in one account and buying it back in another account with the same or another financial Institution
- Selling a position in a taxable account and buying it back in your IRA
- Selling a position at a loss in your account, then your spouse buying it back in their account
- Selling a position at a loss and buying it back in a disregarded entity you own (such as a single-member LLC) or a grantor trust (or vice versa)
- Selling a position at a loss and a partnership or corporation you control buying it back (or vice versa)
- Selling a position at a loss and acquiring a call option or writing a deep-in-the-money put option on the same position
- Selling a stock at a loss and acquiring new shares due to automatic dividend reinvestment
- Selling a stock at a loss within 30 days of a restricted stock/restricted stock units (RSUs) vesting or an exercise of compensatory options
- Double up on your position by buying the identical position at the current price by November 29, wait 30 days, then sell the original loss position on Friday, December 30, and potentially recognize the loss this year

- Today's market volatility has some investors wondering if they are too concentrated in some positions
- Applying simple solutions to any concentrations may not be the best approach
- A widely accepted rule of thumb claims that a properly diversified portfolio must have no more than 10-20% of total investment assets in a particular stock
- A nuanced approach is recommended to help clients find their “numbers”
- Step 1: Identify why you hold a concentrated stock position
- Step 2: Assess your circumstances
- Step 3: Free yourself to find your best path
- Lifestyle spending is a vital factor in assessing vulnerability
- Remember your goals and ask yourself if your investments help you pursue them
- Speak to your J.P. Morgan team about having your concentration risk assessed

- Your company stock position is the bedrock of your wealth, but if you don't need the entire position to achieve your goals, there may be more immediate opportunities in family gifting, charitable giving, and cash flow management.
- Gift to children: Concentrated position can provide a meaningful solution to leaving money to children, while still satisfying ownership requirements and public perception.
- Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs): Can help achieve multiple objectives, especially if expecting a substantial increase in stock value; asset appreciation above a predetermined hurdle rate transfers to the next generation free of transfer tax.
- Give charitably: Direct gifts and donor-advised funds (DAFs) are more tax-efficient than cash; can receive deduction for market value of gift and avoid taxes on embedded gains.
- Enhance cash flow: Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs) allow for diversification of concentrated position while maintaining strong cash flow; receive charitable deduction for forecasted remaining assets.
- Borrow against position: Carefully evaluate amount to borrow and potential for margin calls; if company insider, review regulations governing pledging of shares.
- Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 7520, the interest rate for a particular month is the rate that is 120 percent of the applicable federal midterm rate (compounded annually) for the month in which the valuation date falls.
- There are implications to gifting under Rule 144 for the donor (assuming that the donor is a Rule 144 affiliate).
- Corporate insiders who have to report all of their transactions in company stock typically are able to file a single Form 5 at year-end for charitable gifts instead of a Form 4 at the time of the transfer.
- Discover how much of one stock you might hold—and still stay on track to reach your long-term goals.
- To transfer wealth in the most protective and tax-efficient way possible, consider using a trust.
- Tax loss harvesting can help enhance investors' after-tax returns.","2022-07-19","null"

- Maureen Reynolds and Alyssa Zebrowsky are Wealth Strategist and Wealth Advisor, respectively
- Trusts are commonly used wealth planning vehicles, but beneficiaries should consider how the structure of their trusts may impact their entire financial pictures
- Irrevocable trust distributions can vary from being completely tax free to being taxable at the highest marginal tax rates
- Grantors should examine if the characteristics of the trust(s) they have created are benefiting their heirs
- There are three components to consider when understanding how a trust works: how the trust operates, the tax characteristics, and the distribution provisions
- Grantors of an irrevocable grantor trust are responsible for paying U.S. and state income taxes owed by the trust, and the beneficiaries will not owe income taxes on distributions they receive from the trust
- Beneficiaries of trusts with mandatory distributions can expect a reliable stream of income
- A case study of a widower with his own assets and several trusts funded upon the death of his spouse directs him to spend assets from each account in the following order: 1) assets in the estate that are subject to the generation-skipping tax, 2) assets outside of the estate that are subject to the GST, and 3) assets outside of the estate that are not subject to the GST
- Withdrawal strategy to minimize future transfer and income taxes: 
    - Draw from accounts subject to estate taxes first to meet spending needs
    - Asset allocation: 60% equities, 40% fixed income

- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is taking the stage at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday morning
- Powell is expected to signal further rate hikes from here, given the strength in the labor market and elevated inflation
- Markets have been keeping their expectations for the Fed in 2022 relatively stable, but expectations for 2023 have been moving higher
- Powell will likely provide answers to three questions: what is the pace of hikes from here, what kind of slowdown in inflation would be enough for the Fed to pause, and how does a bleak growth outlook factor into Fed policy
- Overall, the pace of rate hikes should slow down and there should be more focus on how higher interest rates are impacting economic growth

- Inflation and Fed response will be defining dynamic for U.S. economy and markets for remainder of year
- Expected scenario: Inflation moderates, no recession due to diminishing inflationary risks and increasing labor supply
- Alternate scenario: Inflation moderates, but Fed triggers recession
- The Fed has signaled its willingness to combat inflation at any cost, even if it means triggering a recession.
- Economic activity may weaken, leading to layoffs and lower earnings expectations.
- Treasury yields may fall and core bonds may prove their worth as portfolio ballast.
- Stagflation is the least likely scenario, in which inflation stays high despite slowing growth.

- Diversification, inflation protection and yield are three components needed in an investment portfolio in the current market environment
- Nontraditional real assets can provide these components, including core infrastructure, transport, timber and nontraditional real estate
- These assets have low correlation to traditional asset classes, and can provide steady, predictable cash flows from long-term leases and services contracts
- Nontraditional real assets can also align with Sustainable Investing goals and concerns
- Examples of nontraditional real assets include power generation, utilities, energy networks, data centers, aircraft, ships, railcars, timberland, student rental housing, self-storage, healthcare facilities, plants, trees, methane removal systems
- The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables has brought new attention to the broader universe of “New World” infrastructure
- Disrupted supply chains have driven lease rates and asset values to historic highs, and may persist over the next two decades
- Manager selection is key when investing in nontraditional real assets, as there is wide dispersion between top- and bottom-performing managers
- Finding the right alternative strategy depends on your goals
- Alternative investments can be essential building blocks in your portfolio
- Navigating this universe of complex investments requires in-depth understanding to gauge the risks and identify potential high return opportunities
- Reach out to your J.P. Morgan team for a thoughtful analysis of how nontraditional real assets might fit into your portfolio
- Review what you own, owe and ought to give away as the landscape for investing and borrowing changes

- Traditional public markets are not delivering return and yield as well as before, leading to increased interest in alternative strategies, especially private credit
- Private credit is a privately negotiated loan made outside the public debt markets, with the majority of today's market being senior direct lending
- Private credit markets have grown quickly, now approaching the size of some public fixed income markets
- Private credit often has higher yields due to borrowers needing liquidity and not being able to get bank loans
- Direct lending may increase income and is relatively lower in risk than other types of private credit, with relatively lower returns
- Special situations and distressed credit may potentially enhance returns, have a higher risk tolerance, and substitute for equities or diversify equity exposure
- Senior direct lending is the lowest risk-return strategy, while special situations and distressed credit strategies seek higher absolute returns via increased risk
- Special situations and distressed borrowers are going through a transitional phase and need capital
- These strategies may not include a current income or yield component, but investors seek to build in compensation for higher total return
- Private credit is less transparent than bonds and has adjustable (“floating”) interest rates
- Mitigating the risks in private credit requires fund managers with special expertise and relationships with the companies they finance
- Private markets are more complex and less transparent than public markets, and navigating private credit requires seasoned investors

- Stocks soared high, then sank due to the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting
- Rates swung wildly in response, with 10-year Treasury yields popping almost 20 bps before settling at their highest level since 2018
- 75% of S&P 500 stocks headed into Friday in correction territory
- The Fed knows it’s in a jam and is acting swiftly and aggressively to cool things down
- Three dynamics to monitor: how well higher interest rates do their job, the impact of higher rates on consumer spending, and the Fed’s ability to land the plane
- Interest rates are tightening financial conditions, even though the Fed is just a few hikes in
- Rampant price pressures have been driven by a combination of strong demand and lacking supply, but supply is improving and households have ample cash on hand to help navigate costs
- Inflation should decelerate into year-end due to slower growth, normalization of COVID-19-driven inflation, and tougher year-over-year comparisons
- Fed policy is already having its intended effect in removing the pressure and slowing things down
- Focus on quality stocks and bonds, add to core fixed income, get more defensive and monetize volatility in stocks, and stay invested

- No two business cycles are the same, but they typically follow a similar pattern
- Economic activity tends to moderate during the late stage, with company profits challenged by higher input costs and restrictive monetary policy
- Expected returns across asset classes tend to converge, which is where active management can help to identify similar returns with less risk
- Equities have historically had positive returns in all phases of the business cycle
- Expected returns from government bonds tend to increase, bringing value to portfolio diversification
- Fixed income: play the yield curve and consider building allocations to core fixed income
- Equities: move up in quality and utilise active management
- Staying invested has traditionally been rewarded despite the bumps
*Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.
*This chart shows the median performance of high versus low profitability stock. It shows that high profitability stocks underperform by -1.1% during a recession, outperform by 1.2% in early-cycle, outperform by 4.3% in mid-cycle, and see their greatest outperformance of 5.3% in late-cycle.
*High gross margins and profitability can indicate that a company has strong pricing power and may be able to maintain earnings growth in the face of rising expenses.
*Low-dividend stocks, where durability tends to live, have historically outperformed higher-dividend stocks late-cycle.
*Growth, where secular ideas generally live, have outperformed cyclicals late-cycle.
*This table shows the best performing investment styles at different stages of the cycle.
*Market volatility refers to the measure of how much an asset’s price and returns move (relative to the average) for a given period of time.
*Volatility is the most important variable in pricing structured notes and options strategies – higher volatility equals more favourable terms.
*It shows that volatility rises throughout the cycle, peaking at 27% in a recession compared to just 10% in early-cycle.
*Late-cycle tends to be a mixed bag for the U.S. dollar.
*Historically the late stages of the business cycle often produce better returns for commodities.
*Oil has the added benefit of supply restraints this cycle.
*Higher fossil fuel costs are likely to translate into higher revenues, profits, cash flows and dividends for producers at a time when other companies suffer margin deterioration as their input costs accelerate.

- Baby boomers are rapidly approaching retirement age and the financial crisis and pandemic have taken their toll.
- Record levels of cash on corporate balance sheets and the unprecedented amount of debt and equity capital needing to be invested have resulted in an attractive environment for many businesses.
- Show buyers the synergistic fit with your company and make it clear that there is more to offer than the expense reductions achieved by running two businesses as one.
- Understand how the current environment is dramatically changing market conditions and position your sale with these factors in mind.
- Cost synergies are easier to anticipate and quantify, while revenue synergies are more difficult to quantify and success is heavily dependent on others.
- Careful analysis is required to identify synergies and find buyers able to extract them.
- Negotiate a deal that compensates you for the value of your business’s synergies and anticipate valuation gaps between you and the buyer.
- Buyers have been losing ground in the battle for synergies, with target shareholders capturing more of the value.
- Kathryn Joy, owner of a mid-sized U.S. manufacturer and distributor of consumer staples, believed potential synergies would make her business more attractive to select buyers, allowing for a higher sale price.
- Two buyers came forward: Buyer One, a direct competitor, saw the acquisition as a way to leverage its expense structure and operational efficiency. Buyer Two, not a direct competitor, was positioned to benefit from the enhanced revenue opportunities through complementary products and international distribution.
- Ms. Joy and her advisory team were able to negotiate a substantially higher acquisition premium than Buyer One offered to pay, as well as an earn-out payment based on incremental international sales.

- It’s been a violent year for global equities, which returned to bear market territory in September
- Views on the way forward are incredibly polarised
- Uncertainty is likely to prevail in the short term, with risks skewed to the downside
- Yield curve inversions have been reliable indicators of recessions
- We turn to cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings multiples (CAPEs) to assess equities’ long-term return potential
- CAPEs are most useful for predicting forward returns over the following ten years, using 20 years of history
- For shorter-term investors, who are unable or unwilling to weather severe short-term volatility, we encourage a cautious positioning
- Found -89% correlation coefficient between CAPEs and forward ten-year returns, over the 2002-2022 period
- Correlation coefficient weakened to -80% when looking at forward five-year returns
- Global equities now trade on a CAPE of 20.0x, significantly below the previous peak of 27.6x in November 2021
- Implies global equities should return around 9% annualised over the next 10 years
- Global equities should outperform bonds by around 5% in the next ten years
- Japan, Germany and the UK seem to offer more appealing return potential among developed markets over the next decade
- Emerging market equities would also be expected to generate total returns of around +9% annualised over the next decade

-Global economy is more resilient to oil supply shocks today than it was back in the 1970s and 1980s, but such shocks are still a risk
-Oil prices and equity returns have typically moved in opposite directions in the past when supply factors drove extreme increases in energy costs
-Macro environment generally deteriorates during supply-driven oil price increases, with the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index typically declining and the annual change in the US consumer price index rising
- US unemployment rate steadily deteriorated from 5.3% to 6.7% over the period studied
- US 10-year Treasury yield rose by 120 basis points over the same period
- Global economy is more resilient today than in 1970s and 1980s
- Economies have strong economic momentum and above-trend growth

- Bonds have lost their portfolio diversify appeal for now, but longer-term bond and equity returns still look healthy
- Pent-up demand, supply-chain bottlenecks, rising wages, and soaring energy prices have caused inflation to speed to multi-decade highs
- Accommodative monetary policy helped government bonds to offset some equity drawdowns in 2002 and 2008, but this has not been the case in the post-pandemic world
- Market-implied expected returns over the next ten years are on average 2-3% higher than twelve months ago, and expected credit premia for investment grade and high yield bonds have increased

- Credit appears more attractive than last year, but caution and selectivity is advised with high yield and emerging market bonds.
- Long-term expected returns for equities have increased, but multiple compression is expected. Quality and dividend investment styles could be an interesting sub-asset class.

- Oil prices have been rising steadily in recent months, mostly due to supply-side issues and worries about disruption of supplies from Ukraine and Russia
- Historically, sharp and sustained increases in the price of oil have often led to recessions, especially when driven by supply shocks
- Global economy is more resilient to oil supply shocks today than it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but still a risk to monitor
- US inflation has hit its highest level since 1982 due to soaring energy prices, supply-chain bottlenecks, and rising wages
- Futures prices in the energy complex are much lower than spot prices, indicating lower future oil prices and weaker inflationary pressures
- WTI crude oil futures are reliable predictors of the direction of spot moves, with a success rate of 70-85% for investment horizons from one to five years in a backwardated market
- Analysis provides insights into average performance of crude oil futures curve as a predictor of spot prices
- Hit ratio improves across all tenors and reaches 90% for longer-term futures contracts
- Success rate spikes at well above 50% for futures contracts with tenors shorter than one year
- Direction of future spot price changes are remarkably accurate when the futures curve is in deep backwardation
- Backwardation signal over a one-year horizon has failed to predict sign of year-over-year crude oil spot returns over the last four months
- Convergence of signal and spot price moves implies a correction of 10-40% relative to the $97.00 price at the end of February
- WTI crude oil returns and US headline inflation exhibit a high degree of positive linear association

- Opportunity cost is the most significant cost associated with investment strategies
- Primary task of Portfolio Managers is to limit opportunity costs by finding investments that will perform better than the market over a reasonable period of time
- Building blocks of outperformance come down to the ability of portfolio holdings to generate superior cash return on capital and plough a significant amount of cash flow back into their businesses at high incremental rates of return
- Curating reading lists and speaking with differentiated sources of information can make a significant difference to the longer-term context
- Public equities are liquid assets that can be traded in a few moments and with increasingly less frictional cost
- Behavioural biases need careful management
- Most successful investors are those that are highly adept at screening out short-term noise
- Best and most disciplined investor behaviour often seen in entrepreneurs and staff who have participated in employee stock programmes
- Barclays Private Bank seeks to find quality companies and hold on to them for the long run to minimize opportunity cost and outperformance versus the broader market
- Decisions to sell normally occur for fundamental reasons such as an adverse change in management, a loss of competitive advantage, the misallocation of capital, or on finding an alternative investment that is better quality
- Sales do not tend to occur on macroeconomic or political developments, valuation grounds, or price targets
- Investment philosophy is to find great businesses and allow ample time for the compounding of their intrinsic worth to be reflected in their share price
- Multi-asset solutions offer partial participation in equity markets in a less volatile manner to help clients get invested and stay invested

• With stock pickers finding it much tougher to generate alpha in developed markets, Asia offers plenty of opportunities for those with the know-how and risk budget to capitalise on them
• Historically, skilled stock pickers focusing on Asia have been better off than alpha seekers in the US market about 85% percent of the time since 2005
• To protect and grow wealth in highly volatile times, having a diversified portfolio is key. In doing so, one alternative asset stands out: market neutral equities
• Alpha generation has been easier to come by in Asia due to the different macro trends, currencies, and sectors
• Performance dispersion of US and Asian-Pacific (including Japan) large-cap stock markets since January 2005 has been 2.6% higher on average
• The spread versus the US stock market was 20% on average, and has topped a mindboggling 200% two times over the last 17 years (2011 and 2021)
• Significantly lower correlations between Asia-Pacific stocks can explain their superior dispersion properties against the US stocks over the last five years
- Both regional markets follow a similar pattern in terms of relative correlations, with Asia-Pacific having lower average correlations in each sector than US counterparts

- Central banks have been aggressively hiking interest rates in an effort to combat record inflation
- Inflation-linked bonds offer more protection from inflation than a standard bond and tend to generate higher returns when inflation is above the breakeven rate
- Breakeven rates in the US inflation-linked bond market are dropping, while UK breakeven rates remain relatively high
- Inflation-linked bonds are one of the few asset classes that can provide reasonable and stable returns in a stagflationary scenario
- Cash rates, as implied by 2-year bond yields, may be on the up for now, but over a longer period yields are likely to adjust downwards again
- Weighing up between the risk of significantly higher rates and the possibility of much lower rates in three years’ time suggests value in maturities of between two years and five years
- Inflation-linked bonds may be a good option for diversifying bond-heavy portfolios, especially with US breakeven rates retreating from levels over 5%
- Keeping an eye on the real yield, the breakeven rate, and the nominal yield matters when deciding whether to invest in ILBs or not
- US inflation-linked bond market offers value due to optimistic pricing of inflation
- UK breakeven rates appear high, despite capping of energy bills
- US 5-10-year inflation linked-bond index has returned 3.13% annually since 2010

• We are in a climate emergency due to soaring levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
• Arctic Circle region is warming four times faster than the global average, resulting in rapid and irreversible sea ice loss and ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet
• Arctic region holds vast amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, locked within permafrost, which is now starting to thaw
• Loss of ice in the Arctic is accompanied by significant changes across the globe as weather systems react
• Result of this was temperatures being observed along the West Coast of America that were more than 5oC above previous records in those regions
• Some of the largest wildfires ever recorded burned in the forests of North America and South-East Australia
• Once the ice on Greenland is gone, global sea levels will be up to 7.4 metres higher
• Solutions: reduce emissions, remove excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and repair some of our most damaged climate systems
• Financial incentives are required to fast track the transition
• Investment that is fit for purpose in the 21st century is the only investment that should be countenanced
• Greenhouse gas removal at scale requires considerably more research funding
• Climate repair requires significantly more research and investment
- Refreezing the Arctic is the most urgent effort 
- Marine cloud brightening is a promising way to promote Arctic summer cooling 
- Research is critical to ensure solutions do not bring unintended consequences

- With the invasion of Ukraine rocking commodity markets, Europe has faced intense pressure to cut its energy reliance on Russia and to find a short-term fix to skyrocketing fossil fuel prices
- Governments have been forced to make energy more affordable and secure, with environmental outcomes from these decisions likely to be mixed
- Higher commodity prices may be seen as an incentive to make the switch to renewable energy, but transitioning away from fossil fuels is far from straightforward
- The EU has set out a plan called REPowerEU to provide “more affordable, secure and sustainable energy”
- Measures to reduce dependence on Russian gas include diversifying gas suppliers, increased gas storage facilities, and building up of reserves
- The plan also seeks to double the annual production of biomethane by 2030 and create a Hydrogen Accelerator to support an additional 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030
- Additionally, the plan wants to accelerate the development of existing solar, wind, and heat pump projects by addressing bottlenecks in infrastructure and planning
- Energy efficiency is put forth as a “first principle” to reduce demand
- Actions to reduce financial impact on vulnerable and household customers are highlighted
- Aligns with existing EU decarbonisation efforts to move them faster and earlier

- Improved precision has been key in industrial and technological revolutions
- Transistors have been made smaller and with greater precision, leading to the modern computer age
- ASML has developed one of the most advanced machine tools in human history to meet the challenge of manufacturing ever-smaller components
- Mirrors vary in flatness by less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom
- Machines like these are essential to the continuation of Moore’s Law and delivering the sustainable benefits of digitalisation and advanced technologies
- Oxford Nanopore Technologies uses ångström-level precision to sequence genomes in real time
- Developed a portable genomic sequencing device that can provide rapid answers to biological questions in the field
- Technology splits a double-helix DNA strand in two, and attaches a motor enzyme at one end, which feeds the DNA strand through a tiny nanopore embedded in a silicon chip
- Each nanopore is made using a programmed bacterium, and has an internal diameter of one nanometre
- Machine-learning algorithm can provide an answer in as little as 10 minutes
- Aim is to decentralise genomic sequencing and provide equitable access to answers to a wide range of important biological questions

- When there are large sums of wealth at stake, forward planning is important to give peace of mind and avoid leaving estate unnecessarily exposed
- Three ‘buckets’ to consider when thinking about how to use wealth: liquidity, lifestyle and legacy
- Liquidity: Consider fixed costs and how much additional cash to set aside; cash has risks due to inflation outpacing interest rates; explore investing for long-term growth and wealth preservation
- Lifestyle: Map out early where lifestyle priorities might lie; balance between prudent financial planning and living in the moment
- Legacy: Motivation is deeply personal; consider charitable donations via will to reduce inheritance tax rate; consider seven-year window before gift is exempt from inheritance tax
- Not everyone will want to leave a legacy
- People may prefer to align their wealth against two of the three buckets: lifestyle and liquidity
- Financial planning should reflect individual needs
- Three buckets are an informal guide for aligning wealth with ambitions

- Diversification benefits are greater in the early stages of a fund's lifecycle due to low beta
- Investors receive a 'liquidity premium' for holding illiquid assets, which can substantially boost wealth preservation and accumulation
- Liquidity risk is an umbrella term that straddles two distinct types of risk: funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk
- Having some illiquidity in a portfolio can be beneficial from a behavioural perspective, helping an investor maintain a longer-term outlook and prevent unhelpful short-term behaviours

- This year has seen sharp price moves and violent rotations in equities due to a rise in yields and more hawkish signs from the US Federal Reserve
- Historically, the main beneficiaries of higher yields and inflation have been financials, energy, industrials, and basic materials
- Sectors negatively correlated with yields and inflation include telecoms, healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and technology
- A lot of the repricing has already been done on the fixed income side, and inflation should decline progressively in the second half of the year
- Equity markets have generally performed well in the months before the first hike in the US and globally
- US and global equities saw a 5% average drawdown in the first two months, but recovered all their losses within five months of the cycle commencing
- Twelve months after the first hike, US and global equities were up 6% and 5% respectively, and up 16% and 13% respectively two years after the first hike
* Equity market performance during rate-hiking cycles depends on many factors
* Non-US equities outperformed the US by 8%, on average, in the first 8 months following the Fed’s first hike
* Developed markets small-cap equities outperformed large caps by 4%, on average, in the first 8 months of the cycle
* MSCI World Value and Growth indices performed essentially in line with each other
* Biggest drawdowns were seen in the first couple of months, varying between -5% for momentum, small caps, and growth, and -2% for minimum volatility
* Momentum and small caps were the best performing indices 12 months after the first hike

- Multiples are easy to work out by dividing the sum of distributions by the sum of called capital, but do not consider the timing of transactions

- Inflation has been dominating markets this year, with an unusual set of circumstances leading to a conflict in Ukraine and an increase in the Energy basket of US Consumer prices of 11% in a single month
- To understand the medium-term implications of such a shock, one has to go back to the 1970s
- Three observations from the 1970s: energy price surges preceded goods and services inflation, interest rate hikes could go along with still accelerating energy price inflation, and it took significantly negative output gaps and strong rises in unemployment to curb the ensuing non-energy inflation
- Principal components analysis of 1970s data revealed three factors: a broad cyclical factor, a fuel factor, and a necessities factor
- In the 2020s, the fuel factor leads the cyclical factor considerably, the cyclical factor has not peaked yet, and unemployment rates have not budged yet
- Two broad scenarios for the next three to six months: either the monetary policy tightening is restrictive enough to halt the rise in the cyclical part of the current inflation surge, or it is not and inflation can spiral on even if no longer fuelled by the energy price components
- Diversifying a portfolio with regards to not only inflation but also growth and monetary policy makes sense
- Markets continue to re-assess risks on a daily basis, leading to substantial moves across all asset classes
- Macroeconomic landscape can be broken down into three broad factors: growth, inflation, and monetary policy
- Analysis of correlations of broad asset classes to each factor allows for identification of hedges for possible macroeconomic risk scenarios
- Precious metals find a place in portfolios as diversifiers, as they are the only one that held up when growth suffered
- Equities are often referred to as a hedge against inflation as long as inflation does not become too extreme

- Finding the best asset mixes for an investor relies on a series of factors, such as their risk appetite, liquidity needs, and investment currency
- Having a well-diversified portfolio that draws on a wide range of assets to boost returns is important
- Private markets are one potential option for those targeting returns significantly above the rate of inflation when deciding how to allocate their assets
- Investors have been taking more risk to achieve their investment goals this century
- Setting a return target needed to meet their investment objectives can be a useful starting point
- A return-target dilemma: absolute-return option can be helpful and even necessary sometimes, but two issues should be addressed before the metric is used to compute the required return for an investment portfolio
- Real returns in the spotlight: CPI+ approach is widely used by professional investors and lets us compare optimal asset mixes for a given return target across different reference currencies
- Staying on course: optimal five-year asset mixes for US dollar-, sterling-, euro-, and the Swiss franc-based investors on a rolling-window basis since 2005
- Drifting away from low-yielding assets: cash rates and bond yields have fallen substantially over the last two decades, core fixed income assets have lost much of their power to generate high enough returns to meet certain CPI+ targets
- It may take at least another couple years before bond returns make core fixed income assets shine again in a long-term CPI+-oriented portfolio.
- Drifting away from risk-off assets to meet a return target comes at a cost, with volatility almost quadrupling when using the CPI+2% approach and tripling for the CPI+4% approach between 2005 and 2022.
- USD real cash rate has been in the negative territory for more than ten years, whereas the real return for developed government bonds has been mostly range-bound between our two CPI+ return targets.
- Reaching CPI+ objectives is likely to be much harder for some time and asset allocations may have to allocate more to risky assets and inflation hedges in particular.
- Investors should build a well-diversified strategic asset allocation to harvest different risk premia while managing the overall portfolio risk.
- Tactical asset allocation and security and fund selection processes, along with foreign currency overlay strategies and smart hedging practices, are likely to be required to unlock enough investment potential to reach required returns.
- Major trends at play in the financial markets include surging inflation, central bank rate tightening, and slowing economic growth prospects.
- Private markets may be needed to bolster diversification and investors can limit the effect of what may continue to be a volatile end to the year.","2022-06-13","null"

- Selective positioning in more defensive sectors and focusing on higher-rated investment grade bonds seem appropriate in the eurozone, as recession risk mounts

- Locking in yields looks preferable to waiting on the sidelines until spreads hit their peak, with US investment grade spreads recently higher than their average in 2020’s pandemic shock

-Sterling has lost its role as a safe haven currency, leaving sterling-denominated investors more exposed to violent swings in financial markets.
-The US dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc are the new safe haven triumvirate in town.
-Sterling showed safe-haven characteristics against cyclical currencies such as the Australian dollar, generally, and also the Swiss franc, at least until the mid-2000s.
-Increases of 100% in the fear index are not uncommon in stressed markets, which makes these coefficients meaningful in size.
-UK investors would be best off not hedging any dollar-, yen- or Swiss franc-denominated foreign equity exposure as appreciation against sterling is likely in stressed markets.
-An unhedged global portfolio generally outperformed one that was purely invested domestically.
-Most of the outperformance of not hedging to sterling comes from the US dollar.
-Not hedging the currency exposure would have paid off for UK investors.
- Surveys by pensions consultant Mercer suggest UK investors have increased non-domestic exposure
- In 2013, UK institutions allocated 36% of their equity exposure domestically, reducing to 29% in 2019

- This year has seen sharp swings in financial markets, driven by uncertainty around inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions
- Research shows that investors commonly overreact in market storms, assigning more weight to events that are easier to recall
- Earnings announcements frequently cause knee-jerk reactions, as the implied volatility associated with the relevant company often spikes ahead of the announcement
- Being mindful of these tendencies, and remaining focused on long-term goals, can help stay calm and stay invested in turbulent times
- Market sentiment can become excessively bearish or bullish, prompting knee-jerk responses from investors
- Sentiment can be so bearish that investors cling to any positive news, and even overreact to it
- Previous troughs in sentiment have followed major geopolitical shocks, which is a possibility depending on how the situation in Ukraine evolves
- Stocks are more likely to rise if there has just been a sell-off, making staying invested a better strategy than attempting to time the market
- Implied volatility is a metric based on options markets and captures the market’s view of how volatile a security’s price might be in the future
- Earnings announcements are events which attract much interest as well as considerable new data on individual companies
- Implied volatility spikes before earnings announcements and collapse after publications as the unknown has become known
- Following a fall of at least 10%, implied volatility of puts exceeded the ex-post realised volatility of the underlying stock by 25.3%
- Put options become overpriced following extreme recent price drops due to the demand generated by panicking investors
- Call options become similarly overpriced following price rises due to investors becoming overly excited
- For long-term investors, it is important to respond to market events in a measured and proportionate way
- Consider questions such as: is the news fundamentally significant to investors, is the event likely to have a long-lasting impact on my portfolio, does market sentiment seem excessively bullish or bearish, am I placing the right weight on this event, versus historical data, and am I considering the possible opportunities as well as the risks?

- 2-year Treasury yield has risen since September, pre-empting US interest rate rises
- US Federal Reserve likely to lift rates five times this year, depending on inflation and growth
- Terminal rate (allowing economy to achieve trend growth without excess inflation) will be key driver for long-end yields
- Higher leverage and potentially lower trend growth suggest economy less likely to withstand rates substantially beyond 2.25%
- Positioning at medium point of curve, with moderate credit exposure, more appealing in this environment
- Market pricing in fast pace of normalisation
- Fed has to be more “nimble” in fight against higher inflation
- Fed likely to settle for up to five 25bp hikes this year, lifting upper limit to 1.5%
- 2-year yield started to climb thirteen months ago, illustrating market excitement
- Flatness at long end of curve hints of confidence that Fed can tame inflation in medium to longer run
- 8 Fed hikes not extreme, but 2-year yield tends to overshoot peak in policy rate by around 80bp
- Central banks are trying to protect the economy and consumers from “entrenched” and elevated inflation
- Market implies a lower terminal point, leading to a flatness in the curve
- 1-year projected 5-year forward rate is only 15bp higher than the current spot rate
- Entire 1-year projected curve is inverted
- Terminal rate would require a much higher trend or equilibrium growth, or the excessive stagflation seen in 1980s
- Leverage means the economy is less likely to withstand rates substantially beyond 2.25%

- Reduction in monetary accommodation and increasing uncertainty over the long-term inflation path could lift the term premium out of negative territory

• COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a boom in the creation of small businesses in the US
• Choice of legal entity affects taxes, personal protection from debts and losses
• Key pros and cons of the six most common US business entities:
    o Sole Proprietorship: Simple and inexpensive to create, but personal liability and tax reporting can be difficult
    o General Partnership: No limit to number of partners, but all partners are personally liable for debts and losses
    o Limited Partnership: Investors receive lion’s share of business’s ownership and profits, but general partner is personally liable for all debts and losses
    o S Corporation: Pass-through entity for income tax purposes, but rigid rules must be followed
    o C Corporation: Insulates shareholders from personal liability, but can have only one class of stock
    o Limited Liability Company (LLC): Pass-through entity for income tax purposes, but subject to state-level fees and reporting requirements
- Pros of LLC: Highly flexible form of ownership, no taxation at the entity level, liability for the entity’s losses is limited to the entity’s assets, can have one or more than one owner, may have the flexibility to determine how it is treated for tax purposes.
- Cons of LLC: Requires paperwork, annual filing fees and other administrative costs.
- Pros of C Corporation: Limited liability.
- Cons of C Corporation: Subject to “double taxation” (i.e., first, the corporation’s earnings are taxed, then shareholders pay tax on dividends they receive from net earnings).
- Potential partial remedy for double taxation: Qualified small business stock (QSBS) can generally avoid, on the sale of their shares, capital gains tax up to the greater of $10 million or 10 times their basis in the shares sold.","2023-01-17","Starting a new business?

- Understand the climate metrics on offer
- Assess the data and reporting for your investments
- Impact management is an ongoing and iterative process of measuring, assessing, and improving your portfolio’s impact on people and planet
- Impact essentially describes a change, positive or negative, intended or unintended, on the real world
- Five dimensions of impact: What (outcome occurs?), Who (experiences it?), How much (of the outcome occurs?), Contribution (how much would have happened anyway?), Risk (of the outcome not occurring as expected)
- Metrics focus on current carbon emissions, economic carbon intensity, physical intensity measure, implied temperature rise metric, climate value-at-risk
- Understand which climate calculation methodologies your investment manager is using and why
- Impact reporting is the process of collecting and presenting (climate) metrics and data in an informative way to be able to take action
- EU and other jurisdictions are developing and launching classification systems, or taxonomies, for environmentally sustainable economic activities
- Defining and standardising what can be considered “green” to help investors understand and compare different investments
- Companies not yet in alignment to the Paris Agreement or a net-zero trajectory should have an established plan to achieve alignment over time
- Framing climate reporting as an opportunity to inform investment decision-making, rather than an attempt to perfectly quantify climate impact, can be highly valuable
- Strategies to reduce carbon exposure include excluding the highest carbon emitters, and/or divesting of existing ones, or tilting the portfolio away from higher-emitting companies and towards lower emitters
- Voting and engagement can be a way to contribute as an investor by expressing rights as a shareholder
- Investing in solutions to decarbonise the real economy

- The beginning of a new year is a good time to reflect on personal goals and ambitions, and to get financial affairs in order before the January and April deadlines.
- Being aware of the options available, such as the £20,000 Individual Savings Allowance (ISA) and Enterprise Investment Vehicles (EIS) and Venture Capital Trusts (VCT), can help with wealth accumulation.
- Pensions remain one of the most efficient savings vehicles over the long term, but the annual contribution allowance is capped at £40,000 and the lifetime limit is currently capped at £1,073,100.
- Writing a Will is important, as being married does not automatically lead to a spousal transfer of assets upon death and divorce does not nullify an ex-spouse’s original entitlements.
- Gift Aid is a tax relief for UK donors, and an opportunity for recipient charities to increase the funds gifted to them.
- Asking yourself simple-but-important questions regularly can help keep wealth and goals in sync.

- After a rough 2022, investors should try to avoid focusing on short-term market moves and instead remain laser-focused on longer-term developments
- Doing less, rather than more, may be a better option for the long-term investor

- Despite the recent surge in inflation, hikes in interest rates and risks of a recession in leading economies, the outlook remains positive for long-term investors
- Common behavioural traits investors should look out for this year include reacting to unexpected short-term market developments, seeking expert commentary, thinking about ‘the market’ instead of their portfolio, checking market and portfolio performance too frequently, attempting to time the market, letting behavioural biases impair investment decision-making, extrapolating events in 2023 out into the future, and focusing on short-term performance over beating inflation
